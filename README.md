# CS-340 Client/Server Development


# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To make a program that achieves all of these qualities, utilizing and naming clearly functions is important. For the CRUD Python module, I have a function for each of the elements of CRUD, each labeled as such. I also have an extra function for R that just reads one entry instead of multiple. Having this clear Read functon that reads multiple entries is what the dashboard widgets used to get the data from the collection. Many other dashboards could be created to utilize this CRUD file. In addition, this CRUD file can be altered to access any collection, not just the animals collection.



# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

First, you need to have the knowledge of at least the basics of the coding needed for the project, that'll give you a basis to research the more intricate details needed. Next, you need to be able to interpret and understand what the client is requesting and then envision how to incorporate it into a running program. I had limited knowledge of using a database to make interactive tables and graphs. These were new skills that I nejoyed learning. Databases are a huge part of the computer science world because information/data is the key to any company's success.



# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists first get an understanding of what their client wants and then works on iterating through a development process that achieves the client's specifications. This is the skills that this course touched on. This type of project is exactly what I could expect to work on in the future with a company or client.
